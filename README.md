# contour_and_surface_plots_python
Functions for creating contour and surface plots.

Dependencies: numpy and matplitlib

My Python code includes three functions, two of which are functional. The first two functions can create contour and surface plots based on a function as inputs. The bounds can be adjusted.

The third function was intended to create gradient field plots. I need help figuring out how to connect the math input function to the gradient function and then to a vector plot output. I think I can do any of them individually, but something about the combination is breaking my brain. I included the only bit of code I didn't scrap. Maybe I'll come back, and it'll point me in the right direction. I wrapped the third function in quotation marks so it isn't callable.
